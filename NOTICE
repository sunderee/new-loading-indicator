This project is a fork of loading_indicator, originally created by TinoGuo and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

The original package, which appears to be unmaintained, provides a collection of loading animations written in pure Dart for Flutter applications, inspired by loaders.css and NVActivityIndicatorView. It includes 34 different animation types, ranging from simple pulse animations to complex geometric patterns.

This fork was created to:

- Modernize the codebase for compatibility with the latest Flutter/Dart SDK versions
- Update outdated dependencies
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Provide detailed documentation for maintainability
- Ensure ongoing maintenance and active development
