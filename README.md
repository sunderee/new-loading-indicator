# new_loading_indicator

A fork of the [`loading_indicator`](https://pub.dev/packages/loading_indicator) package.

## Motivation

The original package is unmaintained, has outdated dependencies, poor documentation, and was written without a single test. This fork aims to:

- Modernize the codebase for compatibility with the latest Flutter/Dart SDK versions
- Update outdated dependencies
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Provide detailed documentation for maintainability
- Ensure ongoing maintenance and active development
